It updates the game state, handles input from capacitive sensors, and refreshes the LED matrix display. The game checks for button presses using capacitive sensors and updates the game state accordingly. Tiles are moved down one row, and a new tile is generated at the top row periodically.</p> <p><strong>Game Logic:</strong> The <code>moveTilesDown()</code> function moves existing tiles down one row, while the <code>generateNewTile()</code> function randomly generates a new tile at the top row. Button presses are detected using capacitive sensors. If the correct button is pressed, the score is incremented; otherwise, lives are decremented.</p> <p><strong>Screen Refresh:</strong> The <code>refreshScreen()</code> function updates the LED matrix display by iterating over rows and columns. It turns on LEDs where the row is <code>HIGH</code> and the column is <code>LOW</code>, representing the intersection of rows and columns. Pixels are turned off by setting the column pin to <code>HIGH</code> when the pixel state is <code>LOW</code>.</p>';return{c(){e=n("div"),e.innerHTML=l,this.h()},l(c){e=i(c,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(e)!=="svelte-1pzofww"&&(e.innerHTML=l),this.h()},h(){b(e,"class","report")},m(c,y){Ie(c,e,y)},p:Fe,d(c){c&&m(e)}}}function Ct(g){let e,l,c="<strong>Introduction:</strong>",y,f,C=`The provided code implements an interactive LCD controlled by photoresistors and capacitive sensors.

They asserted that &quot;a disability is defined as a mismatch in human interaction.&quot; This perspective challenges the conventional understanding of disabilities, suggesting that many are not inherent flaws or limitations of the individual but rather arise from a lack of support and accommodation in their environment.
                    <br/>
                    In essence, this viewpoint shifts the focus from the individual&#39;s impairment to the societal and environmental barriers that prevent them from fully participating in various activities, including gaming. By embracing this perspective, the Xbox team emphasized the importance of creating inclusive products and environments that empower individuals with disabilities to engage more fully in the activities they enjoy.

                    This approach to understanding and addressing disabilities highlights the need for more inclusive design practices across various industries, not just gaming.

                    A compelling question arises: why is it important to make such accommodations in something as seemingly trivial as video games? Beyond the simple premise that everyone deserves the chance to experience these enjoyable activities, there is a deeper significance. The genesis of the Adaptive Controller can be traced back to veterans who utilized video games as a form of prescribed therapy. Veterans account for a disproportionate number of suicides, and a psychological study demonstrated that veterans prescribed video games exhibited better signs of recovery from severe depression.`,D,L,k="<strong>Finalized Idea #1:</strong>",A,B,G="So we're going to make an IMU controller for an fpv drone.

                    We have two parts covered, the two controllers. We find a project from another individual who is working towards building an esp32 drone and he lists a few parts for us an 8.5x20mm Motor 3-5V brushed motor and propellor combo, a CAD file for the frame, and a P-channel MOSFET transistor for making his own ESC.`,Ue,ae,xe="Addressing communication channel",We,se,qe="As I said earlier we wanted to use Wifi.

                    The transistor ended up being too small to actually try and write an electronic speed controller with, even though the GPIO pins on the esp32 actually have a way of sending varying voltages, which would've allowed us to manipulate the current to the motor. Because the transistor was too small, it was just almost impossible for unexperienced to work with using just tweezers and a soldering iron.`,pe,Le,Q,Ee,Y,me,Pe,F,Re="<strong>What did we learn?</strong>",He,H,r=`Our journey in building an IMU drone controller provided us with valuable learning experiences and insights. Firstly, we gained a deeper understanding of the intricate components and technologies involved in drone construction, including the role of IMUs in flight stabilization and control.
                    <br/>
                    Additionally, we learned the importance of thorough planning and research in project development. Identifying suitable electronic parts, establishing communication channels between controllers, and designing a suitable housing demanded meticulous attention to detail and problem-solving skills.
                    <br/>
                    Furthermore, our project underscored the significance of experimentation and iteration in the prototyping process. Despite encountering challenges such as incompatible components and design limitations, each setback served as an opportunity for learning and refinement.
                    <br/>
                    Importantly, our experience highlighted the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge-sharing. By drawing upon resources and insights from diverse sources, including online communities and existing projects, we were able to navigate challenges more effectively and enrich our understanding.
                    <br/>
                    Ultimately, our venture into building an IMU drone controller not only expanded our technical competencies but also cultivated essential skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability. These lessons will undoubtedly inform and enhance our future endeavors in the realm of technology and innovation.`,je;return de=new Ae({props:{im_index:3}}),R=new Ae({props:{im_index:4}}),Q=new
